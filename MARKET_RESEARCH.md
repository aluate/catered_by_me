# Market Research: Recipe-to-Schedule Planning Tools

## Executive Summary

**Catered By Me** operates in a **unique niche**: converting recipes into minute-by-minute cooking schedules. Most competitors focus on meal delivery, corporate catering, or meal planning apps, but **none offer recipe-to-timeline scheduling**.

---

## Direct Competitors (Recipe-to-Schedule)

### None Found
After extensive research, **no direct competitors** were found offering:
- Recipe parsing → structured cooking schedule
- Station-based timeline (prep, stove, oven)

- Capacity coaching (oven conflicts, prep windows)

**This is our blue ocean opportunity.**
